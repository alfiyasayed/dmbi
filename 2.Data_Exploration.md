5. Explain different types of distance measures that can be used to compute the distances between two clusters ?

6. Consider the following data points 

13,15,16,16,19,20,20,21,22,22,25,25,25,25,30,33,33,35,35,35,35,36,40,45,46,52,70
a) What is the mean of the data ? what is the median ?
b) What is the mode of the data ?
c) What is the midrange of the data ?
d) Can you find (roughly ) first quartile and third quartile of the data ? 
e) Show a box plot of the data.


(a) What is the mean of the data? What is the median?
The (arithmetic) mean of the data is: 
xi = 809=27 = 30 (Equation 2.1). The median (middle value of the ordered set, as the number of values in the set is odd) of the data is: 25.

(b) What is the mode of the data? Comment on the data's modality (i.e., bimodal, trimodal, etc.).
This data set has two values that occur with the same highest frequency and is, therefore, bimodal.
The modes (values occurring with the greatest frequency) of the data are 25 and 35.

(c) What is the midrange of the data?
The midrange (average of the largest and smallest values in the data set) of the data is: (70+13)=2 =41:5

(d) Can you find (roughly) the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3) of the data?
The first quartile (corresponding to the 25th percentile) of the data is: 20. The third quartile (corresponding to the 75th percentile) of the data is: 35.

(e) Give the five-number summary of the data.
The five number summary of a distribution consists of the minimum value, ¯rst quartile, median value,third quartile, and maximum value. It provides a good summary of the shape of the distribution and for this data is: 13, 20, 25, 35, 70.

(f) Show a boxplot of the data.

(g) How is a quantile-quantile plot di®erent from a quantile plot?
A quantile plot is a graphical method used to show the approximate percentage of values below or
equal to the independent variable in a univariate distribution. Thus, it displays quantile information
for all the data, where the values measured for the independent variable are plotted against their
corresponding quantile.
A quantile-quantile plot however, graphs the quantiles of one univariate distribution against the corre-
sponding quantiles of another univariate distribution. Both axes display the range of values measured
for their corresponding distribution, and points are plotted that correspond to the quantile values of
the two distributions. A line (y = x) can be added to the graph along with points representing where
the first, second and third quantiles lie to increase the graph's informational value. Points that lie
above such a line indicate a correspondingly higher value for the distribution plotted on the y-axis
than for the distribution plotted on the x-axis at the same quantile. The opposite effect is true for
points lying below this line.

7. Describe the different visualization techniques that can be used in the data mining.
